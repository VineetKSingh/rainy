// Package pkg provides functionality similar to the AWS CLI cloudformation package command
// but has greater flexibility, allowing content to be included anywhere in a template
//
// To include content into your templates, use any of the following either as YAML tags
// or as one-property objects, much as AWS instrinsic functions are used, e.g. "Fn::Join"
//
// `Rain::Include`: insert the content of the file into the template directly. The file must be in YAML or JSON format.
// `Rain::Embed`: insert the content of the file as a string
// `Rain::S3Http`: uploads the file or directory (zipping it first) to S3 and returns the HTTP URI (i.e. `https://bucket.s3.region.amazonaws.com/key`)
// `Rain::S3`: a string value uploads the file or directory (zipping it first) to S3 and returns the S3 URI (i.e. `s3://bucket/key`)
// `Rain::S3`: an object with the following properties
//    `Path`: path to the file or directory. If a directory is supplied, it will be zipped before uploading to S3
//    `BucketProperty`: Name of returned property that will contain the bucket name
//    `KeyProperty`: Name of returned property that will contain the object key
//    `VersionProperty`: (optional) Name of returned property that will contain the object version
