## rain pkg

Package local artifacts into a template

### Synopsis

Performs the same functions as "aws cloudformation package" but with added functionality.

You may use the following, rain-specific directives in templates packaged with "rain pkg":

  !Rain::Embed <path>          Embeds the contents of the file at <path> into the template as a string

  !Rain::Include <path>        Reads the file at <path> as YAML/JSON and inserts the resulting object into the template

  !Rain::S3Http <path>         Uploads <path> (zipping first if it is a directory) to S3
                               and embeds the S3 HTTP URL into the template as a string

  !Rain::S3 <path>             Uploads <path> (zipping first if it is a directory) to S3
                               and embeds the S3 URI into the template as a string

  !Rain::S3 <object>           supply an object with the following properties: 
    Path: <path>               a file or directory to be uploaded to S3
    Zip: true|false            If "true", rain with zip <path> even if it is a file
    BucketProperty: <bucket>   If you supply "BucketProperty" and "KeyProperty", rain pkg will
    KeyProperty: <key>         include the uploaded file/directory's details as an object in the template
                               with the property names you specify.
    Format: Uri|Http           Specify which format rain pkg should return the S3 location as.
                               Do not specify this property if you supply BucketProperty and KeyProperty.
                               The default Format is "Uri".
